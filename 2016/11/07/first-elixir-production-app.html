Now is an excellent time to get started with Elixir - it&#39;s early enough that there&#39;s a lot of room for improvements, open source contributions, learning what&#39;s possible without being completely overwhelmed by what&#39;s out there (as may be the case with, say, Gem eco-system). The community is small enough that you&#39;ll soon start recognising the names of people who help on Slack as they&#39;re mentioned on podcasts, or see their replies on Stack Overflow. That feels really great, being able to put a name to a face you&#39;ve seen at a conference, to all those Slack messages or posts. It really makes you appreciate the open source community more, when these contributors become more real to you this way.</p>

<p>As I&#39;m still just getting the hang of the basics, a lot of my thoughts around Elixir are focused on those soft aspects of the language, such as the community, as you can see above. I had the opportunity to speak to the developers where I work during internal talks and shared with them my impression of Elixir - and what I found is that my instinct is to just try and express how exciting and fun it feels to write Elixir and be part of it right now. I&#39;ve made my first real pull request in ages in Elixir and it&#39;s been a great experience receiving feedback and iterating. Programming feels fun once again.</p>

<p>Moving on to learnings from getting my first app into production, here&#39;s a few notes in no particular order.</p>

<h2>Elixir is production ready</h2>

<p>Yes, you may struggle finding libraries for obscure APIs and some things will be feature incomplete. Not entirely sure it should stop you - if you&#39;re able to make the time, rolling your own solution and open sourcing it is a viable solution. However, working with file system, AWS, HTTP REST APIs and so on, your usual bread and butter things in web apps will be easily doable.</p>

<h2>Deployment is confusing</h2>

<p>I have yet to understand releases; my approach was just to use Docker on ECS - however you miss out on some of the benefits of using Elixir in the first place (hot code swapping for instance). It feels like this area has still a relatively long way to go - but it may be just my lack of understanding.</p>
